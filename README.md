# Aadhar Card Centre Opening Algorithm

## Introduction
The Aadhar Card Centre Opening Algorithm is designed to facilitate the identification of suitable locations for establishing Aadhar card centers. Aadhar cards are unique identification numbers issued by the Government of India, and establishing centers for issuing these cards requires strategic planning based on population density, demographics, and urbanization indicators.

## Data Information
The algorithm relies on two primary datasets:
1. Census Data: This dataset contains comprehensive information about population density, demographics, socioeconomic factors, and other relevant parameters at the state and district levels. The census data helps in understanding the distribution of population and their characteristics across different regions.
2. Nighttime Data: Nighttime satellite imagery data provides insights into urbanization and human activity patterns. Areas with higher nighttime light intensity are often indicative of urban centers and densely populated regions.
